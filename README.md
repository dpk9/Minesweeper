# Minesweeper
Rewriting the classic Minesweeper because the one on the Windows Store is a travesty.

## Differences from classic minesweeper (some are pedantic)
* No custom game board
* Face button is big
* You CAN lose on the first click
* No ? button. It's not useful anyway.
* Doesn't save record times
* Sometimes a button will decorate incorrectly
  * mouse-exiting the button during L+R press causes adjacent buttons to get stuck with a different decoration
  * flagging and unflaggin a button causes L+R press to not decorate it
